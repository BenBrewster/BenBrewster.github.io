# // Slavery Free Communities. 
 
### What factors underpin resilience to slavery?

In the Rights Lab’s Communities and Society Programme, sociologists, political scientists, and scholars of education, law, and business, are showing that community engagement remains—as across history—an essential facet of the antislavery movement. Our slavery-free communities project aims to establish how we might work locally, as well as nationally, to create sustainable and resilient localities where slavery cannot flourish. We are developing transferable, scalable and sustainable initiatives which can help communities to become slavery-free. This includes national comparative research on multi-agency antislavery partnerships, work alongside the Church of England and other faith partners to understand the contribution of faith groups to antislavery action and grass-roots mobilisation, and evaluations of the impact of local press and media campaigns. We are also working alongside statutory and community partners towards creating a slavery-free Nottinghamshire, and this place-based approach to addressing slavery is receiving increasing attention from a number of other cities.

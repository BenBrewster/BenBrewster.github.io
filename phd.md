# // Modern slavery in the UK: the role and impact of multi-agency collaboration.
 
 My PhD thesis (completed in 2019) presents findings from research into the role and impact of five place- based multi-agency anti-slavery partnerships in the UK. The research uses a single case-study approach with multiple embedded units of analysis. It draws upon data from five geographic regions of the UK as the basis of a comparative analysis that involves the full spectrum of statutory and non-statutory organisations that undertake anti-slavery work. The thesis focuses, in particular, on the role of partnerships in victim identification and support, while simultaneously discussing issues and drawing upon existing discourse associated with policy, legislation and the macro conditions that impose barriers on such efforts. The research finds a developing landscape of anti-slavery partnership work, progressed, primarily, by statutory organisations such as the police and local government in each of the five regions. It identifies that within those regions, a range of activities are being undertaken that aim to support law enforcement, improve detection rates of victims, and work around limitations in national victim support provisions by raising awareness, providing training to public-facing staff and implementing local processes and practice. Overall, it concludes that although there is much to applaud in the range and scope of activity being undertaken by local partnerships, more work is needed across the board to evaluate their impact moving forward.

### Defining a research roadmap for cybercrime and cyberterrorism 

The pace of change within the area of cybercrime makes it difficult to identify long-term future research challenges. Such a roadmap is needed to guide the activities of researchers and policy makers to improve the safety of citizens, critical infrastructure, and support cybercrime investigators. The development of an overarching, definitive research agenda for cybercrime will help deliver the long term strategic goals of the EU in tackling the threat of cybercrime. 

In order to develop the research agenda, the COURAGE was funded by the European Commission to identify gaps in the existing knowledgebase on cybercrime and cyberterrorism, and to identify the necessary steps to address them through future research. 

In COURAGE, I led led the facilitation of more than 10 expert end-user workshops across Europe. In these workshops, the project aimed to elicit from experts, practitioners and other stakeholders the challenges the challenges they faced as a result of cybercrime and cyberterrorism in order to build a map of priorities in terms of future research and development initiatives. I designed and led the execution of the qualitative research framework using throughout the projects primary research work, and assisted in the reporting of results.

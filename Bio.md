# // BIO. 

I am currently a Research Fellow in anti-slavery policy and communities with the Rights Lab at the University of Nottingham in the UK. I maintain a primary research interest in Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery, in particular investigating the role and impact of multi-agency approaches to combat the problem in the UK, a topic which forms the central focus of my PhD thesis. Using one of the UKâ€™s first dedicated anti-trafficking teams as a primary case study, my thesis aims to elicit deeper understanding of the collaborative multi-agency measures being taken to protect and safeguard vulnerable and marginalized groups from exploitation.
